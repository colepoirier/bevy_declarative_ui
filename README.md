# bevy_declarative_ui_experiment/
Started as an attempted implementation of elm-ui - an awesome UI layout and styling framework. mdgriffith is the creator of the original elm-ui package, which is obviously written in Elm.

Now I'm trying to see how I can implement the part of elm-ui related to layout but using bevy (which uses flexbox to do layout). I'm focusing on layout to start. If I'm successful at this I will try to add other elm-ui apis to this.
